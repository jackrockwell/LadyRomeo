		<img src="ashaheadshot.jpg">
		<p style="margin-left 10%; margin-right 10%;">Asha Romeo is a Boulder native, and a sophomore at CU Boulder’s School of Music. Music has always been a part of her life, with both her parents and oldest brother being musicians. She is a soprano in the classical sense, but has been able to adapt to and perform a wide variety of genres. For example, she has played Joanne Jefferson in Rent the musical, Sally Bowles in Cabaret, and the Witch in Into The Woods, while also playing a chorus member in the operas La Traviata by Verdi and It’s A Wonderful Life by Jake Heggie. In the past she has composed and performed original music on her own, but is thrilled to have a creative team. She is looking forward to growing and exploring, musically, what Lady Romeo is.<p/>
